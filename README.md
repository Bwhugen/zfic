# What Is This

This is an "open-source writing project" established by Brian Hugenbruch ( bwhugen@us.ibm.com ) as, let's be honest, a joke gone too far.  The goal will be to create a repository of IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE "fan fiction."  Note that all such fiction submitted should be rated "PG" at its most extreme, and in reasonably good taste, with a minimum of inappropriate language.

When a story has been pushed into the master branch, a Table of Contents (with authorial / reviewer annotation) will be added.
